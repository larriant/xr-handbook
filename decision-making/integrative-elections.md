# Integrative Elections

Integrative Elections are a structured process for electing people to role's within a team.

1. **Space for Questions** - open space for questions about the role, expectations, process, eligibility.
2. **Fill Out Ballots** - submit nominations via zoom chat. \(facilitator counts down 3,2,1 then everyone posts\)
3. **Nomination Round** - facilitator reads each nomination and asks: "why did you nominate this person?"
4. **Nomination Change Round** - each person has a chance to change their nomination based on what they've heard.
5. **Make a Proposal** - facilitator makes a proposal to elect the person with the most nominations.
6. **Process Proposal** - take objections on the proposal \(like [IDM](integrative-decision-making.md) but without questions / reactions\) If proposed role-filler objects, return to stage 3.
7. **Congratulate Newly Elected Role Filler**
