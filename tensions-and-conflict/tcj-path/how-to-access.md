# How to Access?

If you need to reach out to TCJ, the main access point for conflict support will be: [conflict@rebellion.earth](mailto:conflict@rebellion.earth). 

Requests should not go directly to individuals in the conflict team. This is to allow us to work regeneratively and be best placed to do the work. 

We will aim to reply to emails within 3 working days. 

All rebels are able to ask for support from the TCJ team, whether or not they are directly involved in a conflict.
