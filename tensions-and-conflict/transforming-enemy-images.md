# Transforming Enemy Images

Transforming Enemy Images is a checklist you can work through in order to go from making judgements about a person to finding the feelings and needs they are expressing in their actions. 

You can also use it during conflict facilitation to see if you are multipartial towards all the participants. \(i.e. you are able to be on everyone's side\) 

### The Checklist

Consider the person and either journal or saying to someone:

**\(1\) What are your initial judgements of them?**

Don't hold back from saying what your initial reactions to the person are.

**\(2\) How do you feel in relation to them?**

**\(3\) What is important to you in relation to them? What do you value or need?**

**\(4\) Breath. Ask yourself: Are you curious? Do you care? If so continue.**

**\(5\) How might they feel?**

**\(6\) What might they be needing or valuing?**

**\(7\) Breath. Ask yourself: Do you feel any different?**
