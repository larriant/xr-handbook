# What is the Self-Organising System?

The XR UK Self Organising System \(SOS\) enables us to harness group wisdom while remaining agile and able to respond quickly to emerging situations. This is how it works.

### **DISTRIBUTED AUTHORITY**

* People fill **roles** with defined **mandates** \(= purpose + domain + accountabilities\).
* They have full authority to make decisions and take action within that mandate.
* When making a decision from their role, people are responsible for seeking input from those with experience in the area or those affected by it

### **SELF-ORGANISING CIRCLES**

* Each **circle** \(or team\) has its own mandate and can define and refine its roles.
* For large roles, the circle may create a sub-circle that will in turn self-organise.
* This circle structure widens out to the Anchor Circle which contains all circles.
* Consent and linking ensure that no individual has power over another, and mitigate the negative features of a  hierarchical structure.
* Each level of the structure is slightly further removed from the nuts and bolts and take a broader view regarding resource use, purpose and priorities.

### **HOW POWER IS DECENTRALISED**

* Authority is distributed into roles and circles using a collective decision-making process. Mandates empower roles to make operational decisions. 
* To add/change a role/circle,  a member presents a proposal to resolve an issue, referred to as a tension, and each circle member has the opportunity to object.
* Objections are encouraged, as they represent important information that can be integrated to improve the proposal, before it is either accepted or withdrawn.
* The aim is to get something workable that allows movement forward.
* The decision can be revisited later on, so it doesnâ€™t have to be perfect first time.

### **LINKING STRUCTURE**

* **External coordinators** attend meetings of wider circles, as equal members.
* This gives every sub-circle equal power to raise objections during decision-making in the wider circle, if they create or change roles.

### **RADICAL TRANSPARENCY**

* Keep roles and circles up-to-date and visible for all.
* This allows every member to discover the structure and contact whoever they need to when making decisions day-to-day.
* Minutes, projects, and other relevant documents should also be transparent, so the whole organism has insight into the history of each part.
