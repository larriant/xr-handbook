# Convergent Facilitation

**Convergent Facilitation** \(or CF\)  is a method for making difficult and challenging decisions collaboratively. It is particularly useful for making decisions that are very significant and bring up strong disagreement and tension.

Whilst [Integrative Decision Making](integrative-decision-making.md) \(or IDM\) is the standard way decisions are made in XR’s Self-Organising System, there are some situations which are more suited to Convergent Facilitation. This is because IDM has a higher threshold for disagreement because only things that would cause harm or move us backwards are considered valid objections.

**Convergent Facilitatio**n, on the other hand, has a more flexible threshold and works by first capturing what’s important to everyone, allowing it to harness more of the wisdom of a group. This helps groups make collaborative decisions around highly contentious situations, such as the Heathrow Action where there was a huge amount of tension and disagreement. 

Another key part of the XR organism functioning healthily would be a group of facilitators trained in this approach and an easy way for groups to access them.
