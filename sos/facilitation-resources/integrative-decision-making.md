# Integrative Decision Making

Integrative Decision Making is a structured process for making decisions as a group.

1. **Present Proposal -** proposer describes the problem and the solution they propose.
2. **Questions Round** - space for anyone to ask any questions about the proposal.
3. **Reaction Round** - facilitator asks each person to react \(if they want\) to the proposal.
4. **Amend & Clarify** - proposer can optionally clarify or amend the proposal based on reactions.
5. **Objection Round** - facilitator asks each person in turn "Do you see any reasons why adopting this proposal would cause harm or move us backwards?‚Äù. Objections are stated, tested, and captured without discussion; the proposal is adopted if none surface.
6. **Integration** - amend the proposal until the objection has been integrated. i.e. the proposal does not cause the objection. Once all integrated -&gt; have another objection round.
