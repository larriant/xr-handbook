# Natural Cycles

Some circles have started to do their work in two week cycles:  


### First Week

**Mon-Tue:** Welcoming, Orientation, Planning, and Commitment Meeting \(format below\) 

**Tue-Fri:** Doing the work 

**Fri:** Check-in, celebration, reflection in pairs or groups. Progress updates for the week captured in a shared document for the following Monday. 

**Weekend:** Rest, reflection, and play  


### Second Week

**Mon-Tue:** Updates and Unblocking Meeting \(basically Tactical Meeting\) 

**Tue-Thu:** Doing the work 

**Fri:** Tension shifting, Celebration, Reflection, and Visioning Meeting \(format below\) 

**Weekend:** Rest, reflection, and play

## Welcoming, Orientation, Planning, and Commitment Meeting Format

**Welcoming**

* Hear from new team members and old about why they’re in the circle

**Orientation**

* Someone remind us of where we got to last cycle and what our vision was for the next one
* Answer any questions for members

**Planning**

* Check that strategic priorities decided at end of last cycle are good
* Decide what work can reasonably get done during this cycle, based on group hours, prior commitments, and need for flexible time

**Commitment**

* Each member says which projects and tasks they are committing most in the following week and these are recorded for accountability and learning
* The group commits to supporting each other in the coming cycle

## Tension shifting, Celebration, Reflection, and Visioning Meeting Format

**Tension shifting**

* Help the group to raise any difficult tensions that need to be shifted before we move on to the rest of the meeting
* Process these tensions in the relevant way \(IDM, empathic listening, etc.\)

**Celebration**

* Each member share what they most proud of from this cycle and what they’re most excited about for the next cycle

**Reflection**

* Emotional Round: Acknowledge emotions that came up during this cycle and ask for reflection from someone if needed
* Role Round: Acknowledge which roles are working for you, which aren’t, and which you might like to try in the next cycle
* Ways of Working Round: Acknowledge any difficulties you’ve had with how we’re working together and process that tension if needed
* Strategy Round: Reflect on whether our strategic priorities felt right, whether they were useful, and how they might change for the next cycle

**Visioning and Peace**

* Visioning Round: Share your vision for the future of the circle and how you think we can move towards that in the next cycle
* Peace Round: Share gratitudes or anything you need to let go of to feel peace over the weekend
