# Tension Shifting

> A **tension** is the feeling you get when you sense a gap between what is and what could be

> A **tension** is when you feel that something is wrong with how your group is working.

We suggest that groups aim to 'shift tensions' regularly.

This means giving a space where tensions can be aired and the group can work together to resolve them.

1. Do a round asking everyone how comfortable they feel to receive feedback.
2. Brainstorm tensions, which could involve
   * Giving 5 minutes for everyone to journal
   * Pairing people up to talk through tensions 1-1 and support each other to bring them.
3. Do a round of each person asking them to share their tensions. Record them!
4. Go through each person and work to resolve their tension. 
5. This might involve:
   * Making sure that they feel heard by others in the group
   * Making changes to the roles or accountabilities of the team
   * Making changes to how the team is working
   * Deciding to explore the issue further at a later date

    6. Ask for proposals from the group that could resolve the tension.  
    7. You could use [IDM](../../sos/facilitation-resources/integrative-decision-making.md) to pass a proposal to make a governance change.   
   

### Other Suggestions

Groups can also have a document or **Tension Bucket** where they can record any tensions that arise during their work, so that they can be processed during the tension processing meeting.
