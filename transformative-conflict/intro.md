# TC Introduction

This set of pages gives advice for how to respond to conflict and tension within XR UK Working Groups.

It contains background information on [conflict](what-is-conflict.md) and [our approach](a-transformative-approach.md) to it.

Also information about how best to deal with [conflict internally](in-circle-path/) \(i.e. not reaching out for help\) and an [**Internal Conflict Path**](in-circle-path/) that your team could follow when conflict inevitably occurs.

As well as information for accessing the [**Transformative Conflict Path**](tranformative-conflict-path/), which is a process run by the transformative conflict team with trained facilitators to help groups in difficult conflict situations.

We also have a guide to our [**Care Council Path**](care-council-path/), which is a process for dealing with emergency conflicts that need a swift response or in situations where our normal Transformative Conflict Path response has broken down.

### Help

You can ask the **Transformative Conflict Team** questions at our [mattermost reception](https://organise.earth/uk/channels/tcjreception).
