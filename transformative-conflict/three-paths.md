# Our Three Conflict Paths

In XR UK we have 3 paths for dealing with conflict.

#### **1. The Internal Conflict Path**

This is a suggested process that a team can use to deal with conflicts themselves \(i.e. without asking for external support\).

#### 2. The Transformative Conflict Path

This is a process run by the Transformative Conflict team with trained facilitators.

#### 3. The Care Council Path

This is a group gathered to make difficult decisions in order to care for people and the movement. It is for emergency cases or when the Transformative Conflict Path has broken down.
