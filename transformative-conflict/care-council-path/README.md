# Care Council Path

These pages have information about **Care Councils** in XR UK: what are they, how they work, and what kind of power they have. Itâ€™s for anyone who is interested in finding out more about this new, evolving system. 

Conflict is a natural part of living and working together. In XR UK, we believe that tensions are opportunities for growth and transformation for rebels and XR as a whole. The Transformative Conflict Team are dedicated to helping rebels untangle conflicts and find hidden treasures. 

But, **sometimes conflicts can be too knotty and overwhelming for one team to handle**. The people involved are frazzled and struggling to see a way out. 

This is when Care Councils come in to offer **fresh energy, creativity and a whole lotta care**.
