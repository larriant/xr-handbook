# Why do we need Care Councils?

A Care Council is gathered to help decide what to do in difficult situations of conflict, where the people involved can’t find a way forward by themselves. 

A Care Council’s job is to explore the history of the situation and come up with a creative outcome that cares for everyone involved. Rebel care councillors will listen to different perspectives, meet with facilitators and others with relevant expertise, and eventually make a decision. 

Care Councils **do not** replace conflict resolution processes. They are gathered only as a last resort, when a conflict process breaks down for whatever reason and dialogue becomes impossible.
