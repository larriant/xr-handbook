# Vision of Care Councils in XR UK

At the core of the Care Council system is a vision of **safety and care** for everyone in the organism. 

Care Councils allow us to respond to painful situations with compassionate strength. The care councillors’ job is to come together around a wound or tear in our movement’s fabric and find a way to bring heartfelt care to all involved. 

We envision a robust, regenerative and transparent system that protects against harm and misuses of power in XR UK. With this safety net firmly in place, we hope rebels will be empowered to trust each other again and build the resilient communities this world so desperately needs.
