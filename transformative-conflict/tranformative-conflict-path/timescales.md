# Timescales

As every conflict is different it is not advisable to put timescales on the completion of the Transformative Conflict Path. 

But when possible and appropriate, we will attempt to find a facilitator/s and begin the Transformative Conflict Path as soon as possible, and within 10 days.

Conflict processes involve many complexities and creating the conditions for dialogue to happen between people in conflict is not easily rushed. The time required for a certain case will depend on things like how long the conflict has been going on, the number of people involved, the level of tension and feelings, how widespread the impact has been on a group or the movement. It also will depend on the capacity and availability of the volunteer facilitators and the people involved. Although conflict processes need time, they are often so much quicker than the conflict not being addressed in a transformative way and the consequences of that.

We will prioritise tending those who are more urgent and with as much care and focus as we are able to. We will communicate clearly and keep the people involved continuously to inform them of which step of the path we are on with regards to the process.
