# NVC

\*\*\*\*[**Nonviolent Communication**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) can help process tensions in a way that supports honesty with care and creates conditions for connection and better collaboration. 

A simple way to do this is to: 

1. State the issue you observe 
2. Highlight how it made you feel 
3. Say what you need to be able to work well 
4. Make a request of the other person\
