# Creating Group Agreements

We suggest that all groups create Conflict Group Agreements to figure out how they will handle conflicts and tensions when they inevitably arise. 

These could include: 

* An intention to ‘lean into conflict’, treating it as potentially transformative rather than something to run away from. 
* An agreement of a clear method and space for raising and processing tensions within your group. For example a weekly or bi-weekly ‘Tension Shifting’ meeting or part of a meeting could achieve this. 
* A shared understanding about what to do if a conflict occurs and when and how to ask for help from the TCJ team. 
* An intention to use [Nonviolent Communication](../../sos/toolkit/communication/nonviolent-communication.md) and short feedback loops to process tensions quickly and non-judgmentally. 

Short feedback Loops are when you tell someone that you have a tension with their role or their behaviours quickly after the tension occurs.
