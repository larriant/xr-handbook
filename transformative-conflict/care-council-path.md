# Care Council Path

We are currently in the process of setting up a system for the creation of **Care Councils**.

These would deal with emergency situations where difficult decisions need to be made swiftly, as well as when the Transformative Conflict Path has broken down. 

The purpose of these Councils will be to care for individuals, teams and the movement by supporting the conditions for returning to dialogue as a community. 

These Councils would hold the mandate of Regenerative Culture to decide when rebels might be asked to take a pause from active participation in teams, and put support in place for those involved.
