# Empathy Circles

An **Empathy Circle** is a structured dialogue process based on mutual active listening. The process increases constructive dialogue and mutual understanding by ensuring that each person feels fully heard to their satisfaction.

### How To

1. The first person selects who they will speak to
2. They speak about whatever comes up for them for a set time \(3-5mins\)
3. The listener reflects back what they are hearing until the speaker feels heard and understood to their satisfaction
4. Then it is the listeners turn to select who they will speak to and for that new listener to reflect back what they are hearing
5. Everyone helps hold the circle process by monitoring and sticking to the steps.
