### About this Handbook

This handbook aims to be a guide for XR UK groups in what we have learnt together about the systems necessary for us to work effectively and regeneratively.

Eventually we hope it to cover all of Miki Kashtan's Five Organisational Systems that must be deeply interlinked:

* Information Flow \(connected with Tech\)
* Decision-Making \(SOS\)
* Feedback
* Conflict \(feedback on other systems\)
* Finance

We think we also need a sixth 'Support & Care System' to allow the XR organism to function regeneratively.

But at the moment this handbook just contains information from the **XR UK Transformative Conflict and Justice Systems** Team.
