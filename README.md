### About this Handbook

This handbook aims to contain a record of what we have learnt together about the systems necessary for us to work effectively and regeneratively within XR UK.

Eventually we hope it to cover all of Miki Kashtan's Five Organisational Systems that must be deeply interlinked \(relevant XR teams in brackets\):

* Information Flow \(connected with XR Tech Team\)
* Decision-Making \(XR Self Organising System Team\)
* Feedback \(XR Feedback and Learning Team\)
* Conflict \(XR Transformative Conflict Team\)
* Finance

We think we also need a sixth 'Support & Care System' to allow the XR organism to function regeneratively.

At the moment this handbook just contains information from the XR UK [Transformative Conflict](transformative-conflict/intro.md) and [Self Organising System](sos/intro.md) Teams.
